# Overview
This Project helps us understand how to use VBA to analyze stocks faster using refactor code. We took 12 Stocks, and we quickly were able to figure out which stocks were worth investing. By looking at our results, it seems like the stocks ENPH and RUN were the only two stocks that had a positive return in 2017 and 2018.
# Results 
Using our refactored code, we improved the time it takes for the code to run. Please look at the images attached below to see the run time.

# Pro 
By Refactoring the code, we can break the code down to make it easier to run and for others to understand. This can come in handy when you are working in a large team.

# CON
The biggest issue I saw with code refactoring is that the bigger the code gets, the harder it gets to make sure you are keeping everything clean and easier for others to understand
